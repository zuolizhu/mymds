As CSS framework added, now it is time to break parts into smaller pieces (components).

---

### Cut big chunk into smaller pieces

1. Create a folder called `partials` (it has to be called partials) inside theme root folder `Ghost\content\themes\whatever`

2. Then create a file component file `header.hbs` inside **partials** folder.

3. Cut header from `index.hbs` into `header.hbs`.

   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>{{ @blog.title }}</h1>
       <h2>{{ @blog.description }}</h2>
   </header>
   ```

4. Then in `default.hbs`, inside `<body></body>`simply add

   `{{> header}}`, 

   ```html
   <body>
       {{> header}}
       {{{body}}}
       {{ghost_foot}}
   </body>
   ```

   â€‹

   then remember to restart ghost by run `ghost stop` and `ghost start development`. The header and description will comes out again.
