## Components state allows components to manage data.
Think about *an object* with various key value pairs and when that *data(state) changes*, the
component will automatically re-render to reflect those changes.
Component state is essential for interactive applications.

step 1: Setup default state object.
step 2: Component rendered with default state values.
step 3: Change state based on event.
step 4: Component re-rendered using new state values.
step 5: Start again at step 3.
